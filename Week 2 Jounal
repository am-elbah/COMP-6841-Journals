Key Concepts Learned:
Most of this weekâ€™s studying was towards the project. I developed a deep understanding of the required project by checking many project management tools and conducting a survey of questions to ask different people about their experience with these tools to make a market analysis based on the results and my reading.
I also read Chapter 4 from the slides and the book and gained a better understanding of risk management in software projects.


Application in Real Projects:
For the project, I interacted with many people who are working in the industry and got their opinions and their experiences on how they conduct project management overall, and what they use these project management tools for. Many advantages and disadvantages were mentioned, which helped greatly in the market analysis.

Peer Interactions:
I asked my professors and my friends who have software engineering experience about risk management, and their experiences with it.


Challenges Faced:
Some project management tools did not have many features, or they were limited. So it was hard to come up with many advantages and disadvantages enough to compare them with other project management toold.


Personal development activities:
I started searching for more sources about software project management as a topic, because the content of this course has interested me a lot. I will try to gain more experience about software project management to help me with my Resume and my job search.


Goals for the Next Week:
Work on the next project deliverable, as well as catch up with the class material, specifically reading chapters 5 and 6 for next week before class.
